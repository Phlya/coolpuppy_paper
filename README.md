# Coolpuppy paper code and data
Code and data used to replicate the analysis in the coolpup.py paper (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/586537v2.full)
*Coolpup.py* is available from here: https://github.com/Phlya/coolpuppy

Each folder contains code and results used for the figures of the paper. All raw data will be available separately for download, since they don't fit into a GitHub repo. When you have the data, edit the `datafolder` file and enter the path to the folder where you have the data.

Code to produce figure panels is in the notebook here: https://github.com/Phlya/coolpuppy_paper/blob/master/notebook.ipynb
